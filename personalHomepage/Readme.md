## Project Objective
This project has two main goals. The first is to showcase my experience as an engineer. But secondly, I've always struggled how to showcase my experience as a hiker as relevant to a career. In 2022 I hiked 2193.7 miles on the Appalachian trail. It's maybe the longest time I've spent without a laptop, and relied on my phone entirely for communication, directions, and company for many parts. I throughly tested the offline capacity of apps, as well as seeing the effect that internet has on battery life.
 
And it very much shaped me as a person. My goal for this project is to communicate both of these things, and share them.
